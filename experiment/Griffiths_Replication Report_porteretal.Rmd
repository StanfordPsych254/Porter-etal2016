##Introduction

This replication report tested study 1a from Porter et al, 2016 "Inferring Identity From Language: Linguistic Intergroup Bias Informs Social Categorization". The package of studies in this paper tests whether people are able to infer the social identity of a speaker based on their language-use, specifically their use of Linguistic Intergroup Bias (LIB): the use of abstract language to describe in-group targets' desirable behaviors and concrete language to describe their undesirable behaviors (favorable LIB), and the use of concrete language for out-group targets' desirable behaviors and abstract language for their undesirable behaviors (unfavorable LIB). The paper includes 4 studies, each of which manipulates a *communicator's* use of either favorable or unfavorable LIB and measures participants' social categorization of the communicator. In study 1a, it tests the most basic hypothesis that people can infer the social identity (in this case, poltiical orientation) of a communicator based on the conreteness or abstractness of their language (i.e. LIB) about a target. 


##Methods

###Power Analysis

The original analysis were a simple two-tailed t-test, and using their original sample size and reported effect size I performed a post-hoc power analysis, which yielded 60% percent. To achieve the desired 80% power in this replication while maintaining the effect size of d=0.62, I increased the sample from the original 88 to 126.  Given that the sample is going to be collected on Mturk as it was in the original study, I think that this increase in sample size to obtain 80% power is feasible. 

###Planned Sample

Planned sample, as stated above, is 126 participants for a 2X1 study design. 

###Materials

"Participants completed all tasks on a computer. They were asked to read a passage and then respond to questions. The beginning of the passage was the same for all participants: “Imagine that someone is communicating with you about a man named Peter. Peter is American, has an interest in politics, and voted for Barack Obama.” This information was intended to subtly imply that Peter (the target) was a Democrat. In the second part of the passage, participants were provided with the communicator’s description of Peter’s helpful and rude behaviors." 

These materials were offered in full in the SI. 

###Procedure	

"In the favorable-LIB condition, Peter’s helping behavior was described abstractly (e.g., “[Peter] is someone who stands up for the interests of others”), and his rude behavior was described concretely (e.g., “Peter said something rude to another person recently”). In the unfavorable-LIB condition, Peter’s helping behavior was described concretely (e.g., “Peter helped another person, even when it did not benefit him”), and his rude behavior was described abstractly (e.g., “[Peter] is cold and unfriendly”). After reading the passage, participants were asked to assess the likelihood that the communicator was either a Democrat or a Republican. Ratings were made on a 7-point scale, anchored by 1, definitely a Republican, and 7, definitely a Democrat. As a check of the effectiveness of the LIB manipulation, we asked participants to estimate the percentage of future situations in which Peter was likely to be helpful and the percentage of future situations in which he was likely to be rude (Semin & de Poot, 1997). Finally, participants completed a demographic questionnaire that asked their gender, their political- party affiliation, and the degree to which they endorsed liberal and conservative beliefs (on 7-point scales ranging from 1, strongly disagree, to 7, strongly agree)." 

This procedure was precisely followed with the exception of the exact wording of the dempgraphic questions, political party affiliation, and political beliefs. I wrote the language for these questions myself, and borrowed the political beliefs questions from Pew political opinion poll questions that were highly rated as liberal or conservative. 

###Analysis Plan

The key analysis is as follows: 

I will conduct the same manipulation checks that were done in the original study: calculating raw mean ratings of Peter (the target) as rude and helpful as well as a regression testing the likelihood of rating Peter as rude or helpful based on condition, and extracting t-statistics and effect sizes for each of these regressions. 

After the manipulation check anlayses, the main DV analyses test participants' inferences about the communicator's political identity based on the LIB condition. A simple regression predicting identification of communicator by LIB condition gets at this effect, and just as the authors did I test this simple model as well as one moderated by the participants' own political orientation. In both cases, I will calculate the effect sizes for each regression and will be looking to replicate the t-statistic, p-value, and effect sizes. 


###Differences from Original Study

I wrote the language for the demographics questions myself, and borrowed four items for the political beliefs questions from Pew political opinion poll questions. I do not expect this difference to impact the results in any way.

### Data preparation

Data preparation following the analysis plan.
	
```{r include=F}
####Import data
pilotA= read_csv('/Users/camilla/Documents/Winter_17/Psych254/Porter-etal2016/experiment/pilot1data.csv')

#condition variable
pilotA = pilotA %>%
  slice(-(1:2)) %>%
  mutate(condition= ifelse(is.na(LIB_DV) , "ULIB", "LIB"))
str(pilotA$condition)
```

### Confirmatory analysis

From the paper (re: LIB manipulation checks): 

"As expected, participants in
the favorable-LIB condition believed that Peter was more
likely to be helpful in the future (M = 70.29%, SD = 23.58)
than did participants in the unfavorable-LIB condition
(M = 57.83%, SD = 24.08), t(86) = 2.45, p = .016, d = 0.53.
Similarly, participants in the favorable-LIB condition indicated
that Peter was less likely to be rude in the future
(M = 33.67%, SD = 25.48) compared with participants in
the unfavorable-LIB condition (M = 53.93%, SD = 25.22),
t(86) = 3.73, p < .001, d = 0.80."

```{r manipulation checks}

#mean perception of peter as helpful & rude
pilotA$MCfuture_helpful_1=as.numeric(pilotA$MCfuture_helpful_1)
pilotA$MCfuture_rude_1=as.numeric(pilotA$MCfuture_rude_1)
pilotA$condition=as.factor(pilotA$condition)

pilotA %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(meanhelp=mean(MCfuture_helpful_1)) 

pilotA %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(meanrude=mean(MCfuture_rude_1))

#MC question: are people perceiving peter to be more rude/helpful based on condition?
summary(lm(MCfuture_rude_1 ~ condition, data=pilotA))
cohen.d(pilotA$MCfuture_rude_1 ~ pilotA$condition, conf.level=0.95)

summary(lm(MCfuture_helpful_1 ~ condition, data=pilotA))
cohen.d(pilotA$MCfuture_helpful_1 ~ pilotA$condition, conf.level=0.95)


```

From the paper (re: main DV analysis): 

"Social category inference. The primary dependent
measure was participants’ inferences regarding the communicator’s
political affiliation. As predicted, participants
in the favorable-LIB condition were significantly more
likely to believe that the communicator was a Democrat,
and thus shared a party affiliation with the target, than
were participants in the unfavorable-LIB condition,
t(86) = 2.89, p = .005, d = 0.62 (Fig. 1). This difference
was not moderated by participants’ self-reported political-
party affiliation or ideological endorsement (ps > .18).
Our findings suggested initial support for our hypothesis
that individuals can infer a communicator’s social identity
from his or her language, regardless of their own social
identity"

```{r social category inference - MAIN DV}
pilotA[is.na(pilotA)] = ''
#creating new 'social identity perception' variable
pilotA=pilotA%>%
  mutate(peterID=paste(LIB_DV, ULIB_DV)) %>%
  mutate(peterID=as.numeric(peterID)) %>%
  mutate(pol_orient=as.factor(pol_orient))

#does LIB condition impact people's perceptions of Peter's identity? (1=definitely a democrat, 7=definitely a republican)
summary(lm(peterID ~ condition, data=pilotA))
#getting effect size for this main DV analysis 
cohen.d(pilotA$peterID ~ pilotA$condition, conf.level=0.95)

#testing for moderation of participants' political affiliation 
summary(lm(peterID ~ condition + pol_orient, data=pilotA))

```

```{r replication plot from original study}
pilotA$peterID=as.integer(pilotA$peterID)
pilotA$condition=as.factor(pilotA$condition)
ggplot(pilotA, 
       aes(x=condition, y=peterID)) + geom_bar(position='dodge', stat='identity')+
  ylab("Mean Political Category ID") + 
  xlab("LIB Condition")

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

#Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

#Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
